abstract = {We report the results of two searches made on data recorded at the CERN SPS Proton-Antiproton Collider: one for isolated large-ET electrons, the other for large-ET neutrinos using the technique of missing transverse energy. Both searches converge to the same events, which have the signature of a two-body decay of a particle of mass ∼80 GeV/c2. The topology as well as the number of events fits well the hypothesis that they are produced by the proces p̄+p→W±+X, with W± →e±+ν; where W± is the Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the unified theory of weak and electromagnetic inter- actions.}

abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034cm−2s−1 (1027cm−2s−1).  At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle.  Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η|⩽5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ, H→γγ and H→WW(⁎)→eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ZZ(⁎), WW(⁎), bb¯ and τ+τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ and H→γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4(stat)±0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7×10−9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.}

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.}
